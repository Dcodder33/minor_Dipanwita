# Recommendation system are mainly of three types ie 

1)Collaborative - Focuses on user preference and behaviour ie user interaction with products and choices made here we mostly use cosine similarity.
  If the cosine similarity is 1, it means the vectors have the same direction and are perfectly similar.
  If the cosine similarity is 0, it means the vectors are perpendicular to each other and have no similarity.
  If the cosine similarity is -1, it means the vectors have opposite directions and are perfectly dissimilar.
2)Content- Focuses on attributes like cose,quality,features,brand
3)Hybrid- Uses both feature of content and collaborative.

# Some of the Different Similarities 

1) Cosine similarity - measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors n-dimensional space. 
   Cosine similarity is often used in text-based data, where it helps measure the similarity of two documents or items based on their features (e.g., ratings, keywords). 
   Formula:Cosine Similarity (A, B) = (A · B) / (||A|| * ||B||)
   ||A|| represents the Euclidean norm (magnitude) of vector A, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. 
   It’s calculated as ||A|| = √(A₁² + A₂² + … + Aₙ²). ||B|| represents the Euclidean norm (magnitude) of vector B, calculated in the same way as ||A||.

2) Euclidean Distance - Measures the "straight line" distance between two points (vectors) in Euclidean space. It's often used in clustering and anomaly detection.
   Euclidean distance is useful when comparing continuous data, such as measurements in feature space or when clustering.
   Formula:Distance(A,B)= √ Σ(A(i)-B(i))^2 for i=1 to n
   A and B are two vectors.
   A(i) and B(i) are the corresponding components of vectors 

3) Pearson Correlation -  Measures the linear correlation between two variables. It is widely used in collaborative filtering to determine how similarly two users rate items.
   Pearson correlation is particularly useful in collaborative filtering where ratings are sparse and want to measure how similarly two users behave (e.g., ratings of products).
   Formula:Similarity(A,B)=Σ(A(i)-mean A(i))*(B(i)-mean B(i))/√ (Σ((A(i)-mean A(i))^2)* √( Σ(B(i)-mean B(i))^2)
